            <h3>What means screenplay to me?</h3>
            <p>
                I really enjoy writing scripts. What I love about media is movies, and what I 
                love about movies is the story and the dramaturgy. How a story can develop throughout 
                a film is very fascinating to me. That's why I want to develop myself and have 
                good expertise in this profession. In my spare time, I like to write scripts and 
                expand on the story, so that it becomes an exciting script to read or an exciting 
                film to produce.
